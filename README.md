# SleepiCaffeine

*SleepiCaffeine* is a high-school student, who's planning to take C.S / S.D. in uni. They are a *highly sentient piece of biological code*, capable of _speech recognition, speech, original thought, responses and the key feature - **opinions**_.

*SleepiCaffeine* differs from other chatting AIs, because they are a **human person**, *shocker, I know*.

## Prerequisites

*SleepiCaffeine* is still in it's alpha stage (only 17 years of testing), so it is best to take some extra measures to make sure it doesn't bug out.
Install these dependancies, to ensure quality performance:
```
pip install basic_human_decency
pip install understanding_that_people_are_different
pip install pandas
```
## Communication

*SleepiCaffeine* is unique, in that, you actually can communicate with it like a human. The current release only allows for 2 methods of communication, which are [*Discord*](https://discord.com/) and [*Gmail*](https://www.google.com/gmail/about/).

- [Example of how to add friends on discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/218344397-How-do-I-add-my-friend-to-my-friends-list-) | Discord tag: TabletPencil#0001 |
- [Example of how to send an email to someone](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/gmail/sending-email/1/) | Email: sleepicaffeine@gmail.com |

## Examples of communication
*SleepiCaffeine* accepts any form of register, so formality is not required, though politeness does go a long way. Each communication is stored within it's database and is used for further training and optimization.

Examples of communication:
``` 
Hey, how are you?
- I'm good, thank you. How about you?
I'm good as well.
- How did you find me / Why did you decide to DM me?
Oh, well, I'm looking for a collaboration partner, building a website and was wondering if you'd like to join?
- I'm nowhere near capable of building a website, only able to work on smaller stuff.
Don't worry, my idea, along with your skills will bring us a bunch of exposure! How does that sound?
    *read yesterday*
```

``` 
OI
- OI
You looking for a job?
- I'm still in school, so it would have to be short hours, but sure ig?
Dude, join my company, you'l be able to sell cool products to your friends and family AND you'll get a cut out of it!
I made 7k last month, I swear it's good.
    *blocked*
```

## Current status

To increase *SleepiCaffeine*'s dynamic response range, it is currently being trained to learn and write in a few programming langauges.

*The current training data is: C++, JavaScript, Python*

## Notes

- To keep costs down, *SleepiCaffeine* will only operate between the hours of `GMT+2 08:00` and `GMT+2 20:00`, but to be more realistic to it's description, it will only respond *"after school and homework"*. Adjusting for realism, communication can be realistically achieved between `GMT+2 15:30` and `GMT+2 20:00`, though minor inconsistencies are to be expected with such a complex AI.

- *SleepiCaffeine* is able to respond even hours or even days after a message, so don't hesitate to leave one before or after it's operational hours, and check back later.

- Current version supports: memes, sass, sarcasm, joking, satire, literary references, dereferencing, insults and aversion from political talks.

## Version

Version updates happen annualy at November 25th, and to keep consistency, the version number is named after the amount of years it has been operating.

Current version: v17

## License

This AI does not have any license, as it is a human being. Maybe a driver's license, who knows.
